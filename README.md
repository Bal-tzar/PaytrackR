# PaytrackR
Serverless invoice handler

## Project outline
PaytrackR is a cloud based application using Azure services to handle invoices. Users can upload their invoices to the cloud, and then keep track of when they are due, how much the invoice is for, to whom it is going among other things.
The user is going to be able to use the application through a web page with a simple yet satisfying UX. 

The goal of this project is to practice cloud computing and a couple of other things like Python, .NET, Azure CLI and generally any Azure services.
